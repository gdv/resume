Research interests
------------------

My research interests are in the field of algorithms, especially regarding
several problems in Bioinformatics.
Moreover, I am also interested in some problems in Graph Theory and Privacy.
The unifying theme of my research is the development of new efficient combinatorial
algorithms, and their analysis from both a theoretical and an experimental point of view.

I have published more than 30 papers in international scientific journal. My h-index is 15.

Computational Biology is a field intersecting Biology and Computer
Science and it consists of finding formal models and efficient
computational solutions to problems arising in biological data analysis.
This research field has gained relevance with the establishment of the
Human Genome project whose main goal is to determine the influence that
biological sequences (such as DNA, RNA) have on living beings.
Completing the sequencing of the human genome was only the first
fundamental step; finding which proteins are expressed by each gene and
determining the interaction among the various DNA sites are among the
most important open problems. The huge quantity of data that has to be
analyzed (remember that human DNA contains 3 billions nucleotides) makes
computers and efficient algorithms a needed cornerstone of the field.
The candidate’s research has been mainly devoted to the design of such
efficient algorithms and can be detailed in a few subfield.

### Sequence comparison

The central dogma in Computational Biology states that sequence homology
leads to functional homologies (that is similarity among the effects
performed by such sequences), therefore it is of the utmost importance
to have some computational tools for comparing sequences. In this
direction the multiple sequence alignment problem has been formally
introduced in (Altschul, Lipman SIAM J. Appl. Math. 1989), even though
it had already been studied previously, and some of its variant are
intractable. I have studied when this problem can be solved efficiently, even in an
approximate sense.
I have developed new algorithms for some different notions of sequence comparison, related
to the classical notion of
longest common subsequence and shortest common supersequence. Those two combinatorial
problems  have found new applications in Molecular Biology.

### Phylogeny reconstruction and comparison

Reconstructing phylogenies is another problem that has great relevance
in Computational Biology, as a phylogeny is an intuitive representation
of a common evolutionary history of a set of extant species.
In this setting I have studied the quartet-based reconstruction technique (a quartet is the optimal solution over
four species), developing new algorithms to clean some of the error that inherent in the
use of such technique.

The phylogeny comparison problem is fundamental when you have to compare the results of various
experiments on the same set of species.
I have extensively studied the problem
In (Amir e Keselman, SIAM J.
Comp. 1997) some formulations of the problem have been introduced. The
candidate has studied the computational complexity of the problem,
finding some negative results on the approximability of the maximum
common isomorphic subtree, describing an L-reduction and then applying
the self-improvement technique (Karger, Motwani e Ramkumar, Algorithmica
1997). The candidate has also studied some other variants of the
phylogeny comparison problem, more precisely when dealing with trees
computed on different genes over the same species set, designing some
efficient algorithms and solving a problem left open in (Ma, Li e Zhang,
SIAM J. Comp. 2000).

### DNA microarray design

The introduction of DNA microarray have greatly increased the throughput
of experimental data in Molecular Biology. Such technology (Drmanac et.
al. Science 1991) has given relevance to some computational problems on
the optimal microarray synthesis or on the experimental data analysis.
More precisely, classifying microbial communities can be performed only
exploiting microarrays, as the microbial external aspect is hard to
study, due to their extremely small size. A fundamental computational
problem in this field is computing the minimum set of substrings that
are able to distinguish a set of strings (Probe Selection). The
importance of this problem is due to the fact that it formalizes the
search for the cheapest experiment obtaining the desired result. The
candidate has proposed, implemented and analyzed some algorithms, while
supervising the use of the implementation on some biological data that
were previously impossible to analyze. This effort has led to a new
protocol for microbial communities analysis.

### Haplotyping

Several species, including human beings, are diploid, that is each
chromosome consists of two distinct copies called haplotypes. Current
technological limitations do not allow to cheaply compute those
haplotypes, but only genotypes (that is the two nucleotides that are in
the same position in those haplotypes). Since it is important to know
the actual haplotypes, a number of related computational problems have
been recently introduced; those problems compose the field of
haplotyping.

He has designed and analyzed an algorithm to complete haplotypes on
incomplete data and under the coalescent model (such models forbids some
otherwise possible recombinations), where the objective function is the
entropy of the solution. The algorithm belongs to the class of
Kernighan-Lin heuristics and it has been empirically and favorably
compared to the greedy algorithm that was previously routinely employed.

Moreover he has studied the xor-genotyping problem, where the input data
contains even less information that in most other haplotyping problems,
as it is known only the positions where the two haplotypes differ, and
not their contents. This formulation is a faithful model of the results
that can be obtained with a recent and economically viable technology.
He has obtained some preliminary results on the computational complexity
of the problem, and he has designed some efficient algorithms.

### Graph Algorithms

The second main area of research is designing efficient combinatorial
algorithms for some problems on graphs. Graph theory is one of the most
important research fields that are common to Computer Science and
Discrete Mathematics, as graphs are a mathematical device that is
suitable for natural modeling of various real-world problems. One of the
techniques that has been widely employed for designing efficient graph
algorithm consists of decomposing the graph and then solving the problem
on the smaller parts for finally recombining the partial solutions. The
candidate has studied a kind of decomposition called modular
decomposition, introduced by Gallai in 1967 for graphs and successively
extended to 2-structures (Ehrenfeucht e Rozenberg Theor. Comp. Sci.
1990) and k-structures (Ehrenfeucht e McConnell, Theor. Comp. Sci.
1993). The candidate has developed some efficient algorithms for
computing the modular decomposition on hypergraphs and k-structures.

### Clustering

The problem of classifying data in similar sets is one of the most
important problems in Computer Science; it is common to have a
similarity measure between pairs of elements and to aim at computing a
partition of the elements so that elements in a common sets are similar
while elements in different sets are not similar. In this field the
candidate has studied the recently introduced correlation clustering
problem (Bansal, Blum e Chawla, FOCS 2002) where a weighted graph is the
main tool for formally modeling the problem. He has also pointed out
some connections with another version of clustering, showing that an
interesting restriction of the problem is NP-complete and providing two
polynomial-time approximation schemes for a different formulation of the
problem.

Moreover he has studied a different clustering problem, closely related
to the analysis of microarray data. In this case, data are represented
as vectors on $\{0,1,N\}$ alphabet, where $N$ stands for missing or
undecided data. His contributions consist of proving that some
restrictions of the problem are APX-hard and designing a polynomial-time
constant-factor approximation algorithm. Moreover, he has designed an
efficient algorithm for a different restriction of the problem.
