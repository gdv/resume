I am full professor of Computer Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca,
where I have been since 2001.
I have obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Milano in
2001.

My research focuses on combinatorial algorithms in Bioinformatics, and especially on
sequence alignment, phylogeny inference, haplotyping, and alternative splicing
detection.
More recently, I have focused on computational pangenomics.
He has also worked on graph decomposition, clustering, and data privacy.

I have designed and taught courses dedicated to students majoring in Computer Science, Statistics,
Bioinformatics, and Data Science.
