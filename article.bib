ABSTRACT = {Being able to infer the clonal evolution and progression of cancer makes it possible to devise targeted therapies to treat the disease. As discussed in several studies, understanding the history of accumulation and the evolution of mutations during cancer progression is of key importance when devising treatment strategies. Given the importance of the task, many methods for phylogeny reconstructions have been developed over the years, mostly employing probabilistic frameworks. Our goal was to explore different methods to take on this phylogeny inference problem; therefore, we devised and implemented three different metaheuristic approaches—Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Programming (GP) and Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS)—under the Perfect Phylogeny and the Dollo-k evolutionary models. We adapted the algorithms to be applied to this specific context, specifically to a tree-based search space, and proposed six different experimental settings, in increasing order of difficulty, to test the novel methods amongst themselves and against a state-of-the-art method. Of the three, the PSO shows particularly promising results and is comparable to published tools, even at this exploratory stage. Thus, we foresee great improvements if alternative definitions of distance and velocity in a tree space, capable of better handling such non-Euclidean search spaces, are devised in future works.},

    abstract = "{Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there has been an explosion of sequencing of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, making it the most widely sequenced virus in the history. Several databases and tools have been created to keep track of genome sequences and variants of the virus; most notably, the GISAID platform hosts millions of complete genome sequences, and it is continuously expanding every day. A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign them to a clade.In this article, we leverage the frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop an original method that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. On a testing subset of the GISAID, CouGaR-g achieved an \\$96.29\\\\%\\$ overall accuracy, while a similar tool, Covidex, obtained a \\$77,12\\\\%\\$ overall accuracy. As far as we know, our method is the first using deep learning and FCGR for intraspecies classification. Furthermore, by using some feature importance methods, CouGaR-g allows to identify k-mers that match SARS-CoV-2 marker variants.By combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on random forest) for clade assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants.The trained models can be tested online providing a FASTA file (with 1 or multiple sequences) at https://huggingface.co/spaces/BIASLab/sars-cov-2-classification-fcgr. CouGaR-g is also available at https://github.com/AlgoLab/CouGaR-g under the GPL.}",

              Computational pangenomics is an emerging research field that is changing the way computer scientists are facing challenges in biological sequence analysis. In past decades, contributions from combinatorics, stringology, graph theory and data structures were essential in the development of a plethora of software tools for the analysis of the human genome. These tools allowed computational biologists to approach ambitious projects at population scale, such as the 1000 Genomes Project. A major contribution of the 1000 Genomes Project is the characterization of a broad spectrum of genetic variations in the human genome, including the discovery of novel variations in the South Asian, African and European populations—thus enhancing the catalogue of variability within the reference genome. Currently, the need to take into account the high variability in population genomes as well as the specificity of an individual genome in a personalized approach to medicine is rapidly pushing the abandonment of the traditional paradigm of using a single reference genome. A graph-based representation of multiple genomes, or
              a graph pangenome
              , is replacing the linear reference genome. This means completely rethinking well-established procedures to analyze, store, and access information from genome representations. Properly addressing these challenges is crucial to face the computational tasks of ambitious healthcare projects aiming to characterize human diversity by sequencing 1M individuals (Stark et al. 2019). This tutorial aims to introduce readers to the most recent advances in the theory of data structures for the representation of graph pangenomes. We discuss efficient representations of
              haplotypes
              and the variability of
              genotypes
              in graph pangenomes, and highlight applications in solving computational problems in human and microbial (viral) pangenomes.},

Drug discovery and precision oncology can largely benefit from the integration of treatment molecular discriminants obtained from cell line models and clinical tumor samples; however this task demands comprehensive analysis approaches for the discovery of underlying data connections. Here we introduce PATRI (Platform for the Analysis of TRanslational Integrated data), a standalone tool accessible through a user-friendly graphical interface, conceived for the identification of treatment sensitivity biomarkers from user-provided genomics data, associated with information on sample characteristics. PATRI streamlines a translational analysis workflow: first, baseline genomics signatures are statistically identified, differentiating treatment sensitive from resistant preclinical models; then, these signatures are used for the prediction of treatment sensitivity in clinical samples, via random forest categorization of clinical genomics datasets and statistical evaluation of the relative phenotypic features. The same workflow can also be applied across distinct clinical datasets. The ease of use of the PATRI tool is illustrated with validation analysis examples, performed with sensitivity data for drug treatments with known molecular discriminants.},

	abstract = {PurposeOsteoporosis is a chronic disease of the bone, whose incidence increases progressively with aging. The main consequences of osteoporosis are fragility fractures, which have considerable medical, social, and economic implications. Adequate treatment of osteoporosis must be considered as a compelling public health intervention. Bisphosphonates (BPs) represent the most significant advance in this field in the past decade, and they are widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis. However, evidence for their effectiveness is limited to secondary prevention, whereas their effect in primary prevention is uncertain and needs further investigation.MethodsUsing administrative data collected in the “Biphosphonates Efficacy-Safety Tradeoff” (BEST) study, a nested case-control study was conducted by including 56,058 participants, aged 55 years who were started on oral BPs from 2003 to 2005. Cases were the 1,710 participants who were hospitalized for osteoporotic fractures until 2007. Up to 20 controls were randomly selected for each case. Conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratio of fracture associated with categories of treatment duration.ResultsCompared with participants assuming BPs for less than 1 year, those who remained on therapy for at least 2 years had a 21 \% (95 \% confidence interval (CI) 7 to 33 \%) fracture risk reduction.ConclusionThis study provides evidence that BPs, dispensed for primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures, are associated with a reduced risk of osteoporotic fractures after at least 2 years of treatment.},

	abstract = {The perfect phylogeny is an often used model in phylogenetics since it provides an efficient basic procedure for representing the evolution of genomic binary characters in several frameworks, such as for example in haplotype inference. The model, which is conceptually the simplest, is based on the infinite sites assumption, that is no character can mutate more than once in the whole tree. A main open problem regarding the model is finding generalizations that retain the computational tractability of the original model but are more flexible in modeling biological data when the infinite site assumption is violated because of e.g. back mutations. A special case of back mutations that has been considered in the study of the evolution of protein domains (where a domain is acquired and then lost) is persistency, that is the fact that a character is allowed to return back to the ancestral state. In this model characters can be gained and lost at most once. In this paper we consider the computational problem of explaining binary data by the Persistent Perfect Phylogeny model (referred as PPP) and for this purpose we investigate the problem of reconstructing an evolution where some constraints are imposed on the paths of the tree.},

	abstract = {Background: Data on the effect of oral bisphosphonates (BPs) on risk of upper gastrointestinal complications (UGIC) are conflicting. We conducted a large population-based study from a network of Italian healthcare utilization databases aimed to assess the UGIC risk associated with use of BPs in the setting of secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures.Methods: A nested case-control study was carried out within a cohort of 68,970 patients aged 45 years or older, who have been hospitalized for osteoporotic fracture from 2003 until 2005. Cases were the 804 patients who experienced hospitalization for UGIC until 2007. Up to 20 controls were randomly selected for each case. Conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) associated with current and past use of BPs (i.e. for drug dispensation within 30 days and over 31 days prior the outcome onset, respectively) after adjusting for several covariates.Results: Compared with patients who did not use BPs, current and past users had OR (and 95\% confidence interval) of 0.86 (0.60 to 1.22) and 1.07 (0.80 to 1.44) respectively. There was no difference in the ORs estimated according with BPs type (alendronate or risedronate) and regimen (daily or weekly), nor with co-therapies and comorbidities.Conclusions: Further evidence that BPs dispensed for secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures are not associated with increased risk of severe gastrointestinal complications is supplied from this study. Further research is required to clarify the role BPs and other drugs of co-medication in inducing UGIC. © 2014 Ghirardi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},
